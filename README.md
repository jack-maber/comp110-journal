##Research Paper 1 - "When does a physical system compute?"

What defines a computer and a computation?
What  is the link between the two?
How does a abstract theory interact with a physical system?
The need for physical representations/examples to explain abstract ideas and theories

##Research Paper 2 - "Experimental Investigations of the Utility of Detailed Flowcharts in Programming "

Utilizing flow charts to teach people is pointless as only the original creator understands them

Easier to create programs - results did not match what was previously proprosed as both groups preformed bascially the same.

Believed before that having a flowchart makes it easier to comprehend programs but their results didn't find this too be true

Helps visually for a short period of time but doesn't help with remembering

Debugging test found no difference along with comprehension of a program

Comprehension again found that having the actual program is more useful than a flowchart and having "redundant info" may hinder the user in understanding the program

##Research Paper 3 - "A Fast Procedure for Computing the Distance Between Complex Objects in Three-Dimensional Space"

Presents a way of computing the "Euclidean" distance ( the length of a shortest line segment
joining the two objects) between objects in 3D space.

Can be applied to a "complex family of shape models" 

"Objects are subject to changes in position and orientation", such as in video games

A lot of maths I don't understand
